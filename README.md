# Technologies
+ Java: Backend Language for the main logic.

+ JPA: Used for the mapping and relations of tables data.
+ RestFul Api: To communicate over HTTP the main methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc.) which web browsers use to retrieve web pages and to send data to remote server.
+ Bootstrap: Framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects pages of web site.
+ JSP: Used on the View layer to create HTLM pages structures.
+ Hibernate: Used as ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for Java language, to mapping an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database.
+ Maven Dependencies: Used as a dependencies manager to specify all the libraries that are used on the project structure.

# General Aspects
+ I had some issues to resolve with the test requirements specified anyway give my project with the progress made.
+ The project has a modulated structure using MVC (Model View Controller), the project was set up from scratch using these technologies: Java, Spring Framework, JPA, RestFul Api, Bootstrap, JSP, Hibernate, Maven Dependencies Injection.
+ As a way of test, the application has a data maintenance or small functional CRUD , in which the user THROUGH websites made with JSP, Bootstrap can manage information stored in database.
ï‚· Please consider all the components, arquitecture and technologies involved in the project solution code.
